# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL
# documentation for a complete description of this file.  A short
# synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# Global:
{% if item.use_global_hba_entries|default(true,true) %}
{%   for connection in postgresql_instance_global_hba_entries %}
{%     if connection.comment is defined %}
# {{connection.comment}}
{%     endif %}
{{connection.type}}  {{connection.database}}  {{connection.user}}  {{connection.address|default('')}}  {{connection.auth_method}}
{%   endfor %}
{% endif %}

# Instance custom:
{% for connection in item.custom_pg_hba_entries|default([],true) %}
{%   if connection.comment is defined %}
# {{connection.comment}}
{%   endif %}
{{connection.type}}  {{connection.database}}  {{connection.user}}  {{connection.address|default('')}}  {{connection.auth_method}}
{% endfor %}
